# Panduit-Blockchain-template
Innovation idea for blockchain
So this is a basic block chain create as a monetary ledger system. The goal is to customize it and then determine a use case for Panduit. As of 
today I'm thinking we could track new parts from creation to possibly delivery to an end customer. But any new or better ideas are welcome. 
I will plan a discussion on block chain in the coming month and we can share ideas.
