##Documentation

An API needs a proper documentation to help developers to use the API.

It is important to have a short but meaningful description about the purpose of the API.

Describe important use cases to give developers a quick headstart.

Goal is to enable a developer to use your API as quick as possible.

- Enable a developer to use your API in 5 minutes 
- Documentation is non-negotiable!

Use **Swagger** as description and definition language of your API.
Use **Swagger** to create API reference documentation.

Generating a API description from code can give you a head start, but it cannot replace a proper description. See also [Generating Swagger from Code](http://dev.haufe-lexware.com/generate-swagger/) for some practical advice.

Use an API Management Portal to allow developers to get familar and to test your API.
